GraphQL Greeting Project
This project is a simple application that uses GraphQL to fetch a greeting message. It consists of both a server and a client.

Code
The main code for the server is located in the server.js file. It defines a GraphQL schema with a single Query type that has a greeting field. The resolver for this field returns the string "Hello GraphQL World!".

The main code for the client is located in the app.js file. It contains an fetchGreeting function that makes a POST request to the GraphQL server at http://localhost:9000/ and requests the greeting field. The server's response is destructured to get the data field, and then the value of data.greeting is returned. Finally, the fetchGreeting function is invoked and its result is displayed in the HTML element with the ID greeting.
